      <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and political leader who served as the President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.</p>
      <p>He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. Mandela's presidency marked the end of decades of institutionalized racial discrimination and ushered in a new era of hope and reconciliation.</p>
      <p>His lifelong dedication to the fight against apartheid, his advocacy for human rights, and his commitment to building a united, inclusive nation earned him international acclaim and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.</p>
      <p>Nelson Mandela's legacy lives on as a symbol of resilience, forgiveness, and the relentless pursuit of justice. He passed away on December 5, 2013, leaving behind a world inspired by his unwavering spirit.</p>
